# Machine Learning Projects Repository

Welcome to my machine learning projects repository! This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects I've worked on. Each project focuses on different aspects of machine learning, from data preprocessing and model development to evaluation and deployment.

## Project List

1. **Credit Card Fraud Detection**:This machine learning project focuses on detecting credit card fraud using advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques. Credit card fraud is a significant concern for both financial institutions and cardholders, making it essential to develop accurate and efficient fraud detection systems.
